/*
Array of Zeroes
Description

You have an array of non-negative integers. You can perform one operation on it in which you can choose i-th index with 0 <= i < n and subtract 1 from both i-th and (i+1) th index of array.

Your task is to write a program that can comment if it is possible to get an array of all zeros after several operations.


Input
Input Format

The first line of test case is a number N. (0 < N <= 10000) The next line is N non-negative integers, 0 <= a_i <= 109

Constraints

0 < N <= 10000


Output
Output Format

If it can be modified into all zeros with several operations output “YES” in a single line, otherwise output “NO” instead.
